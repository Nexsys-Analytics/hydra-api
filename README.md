# Hydra Server Docker

This repo contains the configuration to deploy hydra server using the hwi_env
cli, through docker and kubernetes and terraform.

This is not located in the primary hydra-server repository as it is bespoke
to our hwi deplouyment strategy, and so we do not want it to intrude on the more
general hydra-server library.
